        "in London. The fire incident dataset includes various details such as\n",

        "before formatting a problem. The following are some key points to note:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The `IncidentGroup` column indicates the high-level incident type\n",
        "    and consists of the following categories: `False Alarm`, `Fire`,\n",
        "    `Special Service`. The ‘special service’ type refers to non-fire\n",
        "    incidents, including assistance to other emergency services, such as\n",
        "    helping with moving larger (i.e. bariatric) patients/people or\n",
        "    rescuing people from lifts/elevators. The `False Alarm` type refers\n",
        "    to fire callouts where no actual fire or emergency was present, and\n",
        "    is further divided into three subtypes, including `AFA`,\n",
        "    `False alarm - Good intent`, and `False alarm - Malicious` (see\n",
        "    `StopCodeDescription` column). Obviously, if your research question\n",
        "    is about fire incidents or fire risk, you should only focus on the\n",
        "    `Fire` and `False Alarm` types in this column and remove\n",
        "    `Special Service` type.\n",
        "2.  The location precision of incidents at Dwellings (i.e. residential\n",
        "    buildings) is limited to the postcode district level (e.g. N2) for\n",
        "    data privacy reasons. Therefore, the columns of `Postcode_full`,\n",
        "    `UPRN`, `Easting_m`, `Northing_m`, `Latitude`, and `Longitude` are\n",
        "    redacted or removed for Dwellings. This means that if you want to\n",
        "    conduct geospatial analysis at a fine spatial resolution\n",
        "    (e.g. building or street level), you should exclude incidents at\n",
        "    Dwellings. If you want to conduct geospatial analysis for all\n",
        "    incidents (including Dwellings), you should use spatial\n",
        "    granularities coarser than postcode district level (e.g. boroughs,\n",
        "    the whole London).\n",

        "    incidents to improve resource allocation, response times, and\n",
        "    overall effectiveness of fire services. So far, the UK fire services\n",
        "    don’t have lots of collaborations with academic researchers. If they\n",
        "    need GIS expertise, they always outsource to private companies, such\n",
